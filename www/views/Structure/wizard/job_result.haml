  The result of the analysis are a series of tables, available above as `job
  files`. These tables are combined into a bit unique table, available when
  you select to see the `raw` result. For simplicity, the results are also
  shown below grouped by isoform. Additionally, damage predictions for several
  predictors are also made available (extracted from
  [dbNSFP]("https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP")).   

  To assist computational analyses downstream, there is a one-to-one
  correspondence between values in related fields. This helps track where the
  annotations actually come from. For instance, if the field `Appris Features`
  lists three results separated by comas (vertical bars, i.e. '|', in the raw TSV files), then the field `Appris Feature
  Descriptions` will also have three entries separated by commas
  (incomplete/missing information fields will show as empty strings between
  commas). Note that in the combined tables, this correspondence is only held
  between *related* fields. 
  
  Tables for neighbours and interfaces require one more level of separation,
  since a single residue may have several neighbours, or interface information
  may be found in different PDBs. The same principle of one-to-one
  correspondence holds for each comma-separated value, and for each
  semicolon-separated value inside it. We favour this convention for
  computational reasons, but beware of repeated results.

  Although the links in this page may show human-friendly names (such as for
  InterPro domains; or for mutated isoforms, which have the gene name
  prepended), the original tables contain just plain IDs. The excel versions of
  the tables below also include human-friendly names.
