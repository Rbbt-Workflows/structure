  ## Wizard

  Use the following textbox to input your mutations and retrieve all
  annotations, including neighbours and interfaces.  This method is limited
  to 1000 variants, use the other (more granular) tasks if your mutation set
  is larger. Mutations can be specified as genomic mutation `18:6237978:G`, a
  mutated isoform `ENSP00000382976:L257R`, or using any identifier instead of
  the `Ensembl Protein ID` such as `Associated Gene Name` or gene symbol `KRAS:G12V`. 
  The convention used will be auto-detected for each submision and must be consistent
  for all the mutations; do not mix genomic and protein mutations, or different identifier
  formats.
  
  If genomic mutations are given, only principal isoforms are considered. If
  the protein is specified with any id other than `Ensembl Protein ID`, it
  will be translated to `Ensembl Gene ID` and then its principal isoform will
  be extracted from Appris. For instance, if the mutation is given using
  `UniProt/SwissProt Accession`, and the change is relative to the sequence
  reported in UniProt, inconsistencies may appear from wrong isoform mappings
  or due to discrepancies in the sequence. No attempt is made to fix such
  inconsistencies in this wizard.

  The organism is assumed to be `#{Organism.default_code("Hsa")}`. If genomic
  mutations are introduced, they are assumed to be relative to the watson or
  forward strand.
